This small set of one python and a few php files enables you to share a screenshot of a windows application through your webserver. 
You can set refresh intervals.
You can change the crop of the screenshot.
You can set a timeout, after which the screengrab will be replaced with an offline image

Its pretty basic, but maybe somebody needs it?

Warning: This WILL Grab windows infront of the window you grab, i can't be asses currently to fix that.
